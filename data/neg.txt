i just saw , what an utter disappointment.
.. call me boring.. but found it quite boring. :s?
just watched the movie... its about #facebook actually... kinda boring movie =/ boehoee!
disappointing.
is a very very clever film and made me love jesse eisenberg loads more, but there is no denying that it is in fact crap.
just saw : superb script, beautifully directed, but a little too depressing to be entertaining. shame.
one of the most boring movies since a long time (and sleep)
i don't see how the same guy who writes glee wrote the screenplay for . this is terrible.
so for me, is like over two hours of stuff i don't get. maybe my iq just degraded in between that 2 hours. or something.
 made me sleep
i have never in my entire life literally slept in a theater while watching a movie, until
i don't like . i think i don't have the brains to understand what the heck the movie is trying to say.
sooo unexceptional. a little bit dull and way too long... not sure i can be bothered finishing the book now either..
watched . renaming that movie to bored
o by the way don't go see saw n 3d its super stupid it reminded me of final destination which was even more dumb
i saw "" today. that was pointless. even the movies before that, had a purpose. -.- this one was shit, and just plain gross.
omg went to watch  like ewww.. was way more ewww then it evert could be.. i didnt like the film... n im a horror fanatic! lol
 tonight. i'm just stoked i'll never have to see another saw movie
 is just disgusting made me actually feel so sick lol!
 was disappointing
 sucked. just a little blood spatter w/ 3d..cmon give me body parts..something....game over.
btw whoever made  is a twisted individual & needs help asap! what a fucked up movie! lol never seen any saw movies before & never will
regarding : evil i can stand, but stupidity, lack of style and story on such a high level should be illegal.
oh yh  worst 3d movie ever didn't need the glasses :-/ nice twist at the end but that's about it. disappointed :(
was hoping  would actually wrap up the series.  instead it failed to answer so many questions from previous films, and raised more
 was wack asab fucking terrible smh
lol havent tweeted in a while... s'up peeps?? :p went to see  last night.... never again... way to gory :p x
i went to see  again. i hate that movie. it's such a mistake.
i seen  last night, it was nasty as shitt
 is one disgustin movie....seriously how do ppl come up with that kinda shit. good ending tho...
seen ....sick and not in that good way but better than what i was expecting, seen the ending 4 saw films ago...3d was good though
so, i watched  last night. didn't realise it was a comedy. poor. one star.
this is my advice to you : don't watch  .. it's sooo boring . actually i don't like it .. part 1 was better than part 2
just watched  thought the first one was bad the second one even worse that's 85mins of my life  i'll never get back
 is just as bad as the first one |: except funnier (:
 was boring.
= horrible.  firstone was better. two thumbs down. #teamfollowback.

# the movie.... speechless from terrible movie making.
 is easily the worst film of the year for me, although it made me laugh more than any film this year too.
. my review. what. the. hell?
'' is the worst movie i've seen in years. so wooden. in fact the last time i saw this much wood was at a ron jeremy convention.
movie  was not what i expected. didn't like it much. cannot recommend it.
 is one of the worst films i have ever seen we laughed all the way thru
 is not worth seeing i have nothing good to say about it
# was quite disappointing. visual effects 5/5, everything else 1/5.
 movie isn't the best sci-fi movie. i got bored watching this one, luckily i didn't watch it on the big screen.
 looks like shit...just had to put it out there. and they had an awful cast.
thoughts on .1: complete waste of 3 hours of my life.
 - part 1 was really, really bad. then again most hp movies have been.
disappointed in  pt1. i hate david yates. was still okay to watch, but damnit when will the story ever be right in the movies?
what the hell is wrong with cinema today? looks god awful. an unmanned train? with 8 carriages of chemicals on on it?#bbcfilm2010
don't go see . it was awful. the only thing making it bearable was watching chris pine! he is a dream!!!
the film '' with cher and christina aguilera doesn't look exciting at all - i wouldn't  even spend money on buying it on pirate dvd
the film '' with cher and christina aguilera doesn't look exciting at all - i wouldn't  even spend money on buying it on pirate dvd

'' was dumb and a total bollywood movie in a bad way
'' is not my favorite movie, kind of wish i did not see it :( :(
yesterday i went to alegro to the cinema to watch "" and i didn't like it at all, as i thought, a cheap imitation of "the hangover"
 wasn't all that! afew funny bits here and there but overall i'd rate it pretty poorly.
the  (d-/24): sadly, it's just badly conceived and dull rather than amusingly terrible. also, stop the 3d scam.
watching the .... first movie of many today. it's terrible,
'': hide your children from this nightmare
there's a part of me that wants to see the  just to see how freaking godawful it is.
