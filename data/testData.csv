positive,Oh.My.Fucking.God. The Expendables was fucking amazing!
positive,Expendables was good, lots of explosions! If you see me walking home, you'll know about it. I'll be the one commando rolling round corners.
positive,The Expendables is a mix of furious action, irrelevant exposition, average acting and more than a few explosions. Glad I saw it. Won't again.
negative,Just saw Going the Distance...prrreeeetttyyy raunchy. I wouldn't recommend it.
negative,Going the distance was toooo good! Go see it. You will literally die of laughter
negative,I finished #reading the memoir The Other Wes Moore on the weekend. Terrific concept (about two guys w same name) but poor execution.
positive,Inception was A M A Z I N G ! wow.
negative,The Last Exorcism? More like "The Last time I watch some emo try body pop" That wasn't a horror, that was expressive dance*REFUND*.
negative,"The Last Exorcism" was pretty good. Reminded me of "[Rec]", in that it managed hand camera documentary scarily.
positive,Damn jus finished watching that piranha movie on the phone and all I can say its Breasts and Blood lmao.... shit was hilarious.
positive,Buffy is WAY better than twilight can ever hope to be. "Then Buffy staked Edward. The End."
negative,I don't give a damn!Twilight is stupid,te acting is so boring!It just sucks!
positive,just watched Clash of the Titans. I quite liked it.
negative,Clash of the Titans sucks! Its sad but the classic version with the crappy special effects and overly dramatic actors was much better.
positive,Hello. Saw the Expendables which was really good for what it was... need to catch up with This Is England '86 but tomorrow...

positive,Saw Nanny McPhee Returns (fun!) and had lunch with mum and brother. Picked up my cake...it's so gorgeous. Little Mermaid!!! :)
positive,The Last Exorcism... Was good, expected more. Definitely worth a watch.
negative,thinks that the last exorcism was one the worst movies he's seen in a long time.
negative,The Last Exorcism is below average in horror quality and it doesn't help that the exorcist looks like Jeremy Kyle.
negative,The trailer to "The Last Exorcism".........forget watching that film!!! James
positive,The Last Exorcism. I really, really liked it though the end was a bit mental/unexplained. Didn't hate it as much as others...
positive,Well, Piranha was totally worth it. 3D films really can be great.
positive,Piranha 3D was fun though the depth perception was mostly marginal, still an entertaining popcornmovie.
positive,Ahh he'll yea! Prince of Persia in a week!!! Just saw Salt last night. Great movie.
positive,#repomen is INSANE! New favorite movie.
