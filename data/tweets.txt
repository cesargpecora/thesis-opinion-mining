Show I'm working on has had to be stopped due to the rain water leaking onto the rig. Oh fringe theatre, how I adore/loathe you.
I'm not gonna lie; I'm struggling to summon enthusiasm for this #dropdead night. Each fringe I see makes me lose hope a little bit more.
HA. Fringe in having an Iron-Man-esque plot line shocker.

I loved this week's #Fringe episode. What can I say? I'm a sucker for a pseudo-1940's sci-fi musical detective story.

totally a terrible #Fringe episode this week.. Disappointment x10.. not even gonna go into the "special" musical/costume thing...
Fringe is, in my opinion, the best lit show on TV right now.
I love #Fringe (as I have mentioned many times), but that "musical" ep? What were the writers smoking - and where can I get some? #wtf
#Fringe @Jesii28 The Observers/Watchers are trying to prevent "mistakes" in the timeline, and correct any "mistakes" from what was planned.
Noir episode of #Fringe disappointing -- not done with anything resembling flair. Ah well.
Not interested in fringe on either side but dialogue to solve problems. This is not rhetoric #hope
I was hesitant at the idea of Fringe doing a musical episode. Then they reminded us Walter likes Yes and Tears For Fears. Much awesome.
Just watched: Fringe - S2E18 - White Tulip
@amy_vrwc I guess I'm too used to the "anchor baby" fringe to be THAT shocked at it by now.

"In a parallel universe, time would be slightly out of sync" Um. WHY? Come on, Fringe. If you're gonna pretend science, at least justify it.
